# ng-jsdata

Utilities for managing state between angular and js-data.  Significant
improvements in API over the standard js-data-angular model.

# Usage

embed this library wherever you want using the `git submodule`
mechanism, since this library exports ES6 modules directly, using npm
or bower just sucks.  Also, this way you automatically get to do easy
version management in a way that isn't tied into all of npm's quircks.
